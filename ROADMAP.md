# Roadmap

In-repo backlog for `crux`. Epics group related work; checklists are the concrete
issues under each. Status: ☐ todo · ◐ in progress · ☑ done.

---

## Epic 1 — Graphical UI for crux  `ui`

**Goal:** a graphical interface over the crux vault (today it's CLI + markdown / Obsidian),
so a PI can drive the whole loop — browse the tree, open questions, tick verifiables,
close cases, and clear the review gate — without the terminal.

- ☐ **Decide stack & architecture** — Obsidian plugin vs standalone web app vs desktop (Tauri/Electron); write a short ADR capturing the choice and why.
- ☐ **Engine JSON API** — have the engine emit machine-readable vault state (tree, ledgers, gate queue) so any UI consumes one stable interface instead of re-parsing markdown.
- ☐ **Interactive tree / graph view** — render the Question→Hypothesis constellation, status-colored, navigable; the visual heart of the product.
- ☐ **Node detail + edit** — create/edit Questions & Hypotheses, tick verifiables, write findings; all writes go through the engine (never hand-edit generated content).
- ☐ **Review-gate inbox** — surface questions in `review`, with `answer` / `pursue` actions for the PI.
- ☐ **Package & ship** — build + distribute (plugin release / hosted app / desktop bundle per the stack decision).

## Epic 2 — Marketing animation + README hero  `marketing`

**Goal:** a short programmatic (Remotion / React-video) explainer that shows what crux does,
rendered to video + GIF and embedded as the hero on the README and the repo's social preview.

- ☐ **Storyboard the explainer** (~30–60s) — narrative: open a Question → propose a Hypothesis → register verifiables → land a finding → roll up the ledger → answer the question; carry the Southern-Cross / navigation motif throughout.
- ☐ **Scaffold the Remotion project** (React/TypeScript) under `marketing/`.
- ☐ **Build the animation scenes** from the storyboard.
- ☐ **Render & optimize** — export MP4 + an optimized GIF/webp sized for README and web.
- ☐ **Embed the hero** — add to README top, and set the repo's GitHub social-preview image.

## Epic 3 — LLM wiki  `wiki`

**Goal:** a **literature** layer in the vault — a living, interlinked knowledge base of *prior*
knowledge (background, definitions, methods, SOTA, baselines, references) that the agent
compiles from PI-curated immutable sources and draws on, cross-linked with the crux-tree so
questions and hypotheses can cite and build on what's known. Knowledge flows **one way**:
literature → wiki → tree; a project's own findings never enter the wiki (this keeps provenance
clean and prevents the self-ingestion failure mode). Instantiates Karpathy's LLM-wiki pattern.

- ☑ **Define the wiki page** — `type: wiki` pages under `wiki/` (concept-slug filenames), parentless and outside the roll-up tree, linked via `[[wikilinks]]`; immutable sources under `raw/`.
- ☑ **Agent reads the wiki for context** — `WIKI.md` index + pages consulted when proposing questions/hypotheses; tree nodes may cite `[[wiki/page]]` (the crux-wiki skill).
- ☑ **Agent compiles the wiki from literature** — `crux ingest` registers a source; the agent compiles/updates pages that cite `raw/`. *(Amended: knowledge comes from curated literature, not from distilling the project's own findings — findings never enter the wiki.)*
- ☑ **Index & render** — engine-generated `WIKI.md` at the vault root (pages by category + source registry), byte-stable, without polluting the question/hypothesis tree; structural lint via `crux validate`.

*Delivered as the `crux-wiki` skill + engine `ingest`/`WIKI.md`/wiki-lint (ENGINE_VERSION 1.1).*
